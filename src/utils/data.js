export const ABOUT_ME = {
  content: `Hey there! I'm a passionate developer who loves bringing ideas to life with Programming. My journey started with a simple curiosityâ€”"How does the web make things come alive?"â€”and ever since, I've been hooked on building smooth, interactive experiences.

I enjoy creating dynamic user interfaces, making apps run faster, and diving into the logic behind the scenes. Turning ideas into real, working products is what excites me the most!\n

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me listening to music, exploring new tech trends, sketching UI ideas, or just sipping coffee while figuring out life's little puzzles. ðŸ˜‰\n

Let's build something awesome together!`,
